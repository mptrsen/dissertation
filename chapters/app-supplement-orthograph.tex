		Supplemental methods and data tables;
		Figure S1: Alignment regions in Orthograph;
		Figure S2: ORF extension criteria;
		Figure S3: Orthograph runtime is significantly correlated to total transcriptome assembly length;
		Figure S4: Speedup plot for multi-threaded analysis;
		Figure S5: Example multiple sequence alignment of an OG to demonstrate a possible assignment of a transcript to the ``wrong'' OG.

	\section{Additional file 2: Petersen\_et\_al\_1KITE\_apoid\_wasps\_accessions.txt}
		Species, 1KITE library IDs (see \url{http://1kite.org/1kite_species.php}),
		number of assembled transcripts, total assembly size, N50 values, and NCBI
		GenBank accession numbers. Note that the assemblies were filtered to
		contain only contigs longer than 199 bp.

\label{introduction}

We are currently experiencing a mass extinction event that parallels other episodes in earth's history with high rates of biodiversity decline \citep{Pimm1995, Dirzo2003, Schipper2008, Barnosky2011, Dirzo2014}. It is anthropogenic in origin \citep{Leakey1996, Ceballos2015} and is associated with global warming \citep{Cook2016, Wuebbles2017}, large-scale deforestation \citep{Wright2005}, destruction of marine and freshwater habitats \citep{Burkhead2012}, and introduction of invasive species \citep{Mooney2001}.

* Is anthropogenic
* Losing species fast
* need to investigate while we can
* all is going to shit

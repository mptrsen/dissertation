\newthought{I am grateful} to Bernhard Misof for the opportunity to
undertake this PhD project as well as for his input and support over the
five years this project took to complete. I would not have gotten this
far without the discussions and insight from you.

Likewise to Lars Podsiadlowski for his readiness to co-advise this
thesis and many helpful discussions. I always appreciated your
positivity.

I also thank Dietmar Quandt as well as Torsten Wappler for their
readiness to join my commission and their time reading this thesis.

I am grateful to Christoph Mayer and Oliver Niehuis for many helpful
discussions, their careful insight, and humor.

Thank you to these people in no particular order for relaxed lunch
breaks, regular beach volleyball sessions, playing squash, climbing
walls, discussions or ice cream or coffee, helpful input and output,
being an outlet when I needed to vent, or simply for being a nice
person:
Peter Grobe, Dirk Ahrens, Hajo Krammer, Matthias Geiger, Jan Philip
Oeyen, Julia Schwarzer, Sebastian Martin, Alexandros Vasilikopoulos,
Panagiotis Provataris, Jonas Astrin, Claudia Etzbauer, Ameli Kirse,

Romahn, Simon K\"afer, Sofia Paraskevopoulou, Thomas Gerken, Tanja

Heufelder. I apologize to whomever I may have forgotten here.

Gaby Nottebrock for being an awesome Master student under my supervision.
You really made your project glow.

No thanks to Jeanne Wilbrandt for wasting a year of both our time. It
was beautiful while it lasted, though.

Thank you to my wife Hannah for taking care of everything and enduring
my absent-mindedness and lack of energy for anything besides this
work.
